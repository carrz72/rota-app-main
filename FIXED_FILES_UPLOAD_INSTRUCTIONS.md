# 🔧 Fixed Files - Upload to Server

## ✅ I've Fixed Two Critical Issues:

### Issue 1: links.js Syntax Error (Line 109)
- **Problem:** Extra closing brace `}` was blocking JavaScript execution
- **Fixed:** Removed the extra brace
- **Impact:** This was preventing push-notifications.js from loading

### Issue 2: Wrong VAPID Key in push-notifications.js  
- **Problem:** Had old development key instead of your new production key
- **Fixed:** Updated to your production key: `BDujEyd4Q023y8o2QJq1tOVTBbb-ShmmcPZwI8xP-3j7yroNYJXhAaLdFku1qzHLRWDvkGoOvgy2_gAV90yJ2v4`
- **Impact:** Subscriptions wouldn't work with wrong key

## 📤 Upload Fixed Files to Your Server

### Method 1: Using SCP (From Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\rota-app-main

# Upload the fixed files
scp js/links.js carrz@open-rota.com:/var/www/rota-app/js/
scp js/push-notifications.js carrz@open-rota.com:/var/www/rota-app/js/
```

---

### Method 2: Using Git (If Using Version Control)

```powershell
# On your LOCAL machine
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\rota-app-main
git add js/links.js js/push-notifications.js
git commit -m "Fix links.js syntax error and update VAPID key"
git push origin master
```

Then on your server:
```bash
cd /var/www/rota-app
git pull origin master
```

---

### Method 3: Manual Copy/Paste (Quickest)

**On your server, edit the files:**

#### Fix 1: links.js
```bash
nano /var/www/rota-app/js/links.js
```

Find line 109 (around there), it looks like:
```javascript
    window.location.href = navigateUrl;
}
}  // <-- REMOVE THIS LINE (extra closing brace)

// Handle form submissions
```

Delete the extra `}` so it looks like:
```javascript
    window.location.href = navigateUrl;
}

// Handle form submissions
```

Save: `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`

#### Fix 2: push-notifications.js
```bash
nano /var/www/rota-app/js/push-notifications.js
```

Find line 6 (near the top):
```javascript
const VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'BMrynh06K7vNvRFfK9WHwJBpXmXSOj08-4T3FXdxGD2S3LrW0HHbxF0XtqOWwp3Vj3XLchLXvKJqS5K6kY6K-fU';
```

Replace with:
```javascript
const VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY = 'BDujEyd4Q023y8o2QJq1tOVTBbb-ShmmcPZwI8xP-3j7yroNYJXhAaLdFku1qzHLRWDvkGoOvgy2_gAV90yJ2v4';
```

Save: `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`

## 🔄 After Uploading Files

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
In your browser:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- Or press `F12` → Application tab → Clear storage → Clear site data

### 2. Unregister Old Service Worker (Important!)
In browser DevTools:
- Press `F12`
- Go to **Application** tab
- Click **Service Workers** in left sidebar
- Click **Unregister** on the service worker
- Refresh the page

### 3. Test Again
Visit: `https://open-rota.com/users/dashboard.php`

**You should now see in console:**

```

After 30 seconds, the notification prompt modal should appear!

## 🧪 Verify It's Working

**Open browser console (F12) and check:**

✅ **Should see:**
- `[Push Notifications] Initializing...`
- `[Push Notifications] Push notifications supported`

- After 30 seconds: `[Push Notifications] Showing permission prompt`

❌ **Should NOT see:**
- `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` (from links.js)
