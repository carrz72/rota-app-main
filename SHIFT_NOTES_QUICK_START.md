## 🔔 Push Notifications

**When Triggered:**
- Someone adds a note to YOUR shift
- You're not the note author

**Notification Shows:**
```
Title: "⭐ Important: New Shift Note" (if important)
       "New Shift Note" (if normal)

Body: "Alice Brown left a note for your shift 
       on Oct 16: Coffee machine needs..."

Click: Opens shift_notes.php
```

---

## 📊 Statistics After 1 Week

Expected metrics:
- 50-100 notes created
- 60%+ of shifts will have notes
- 80%+ reduction in "I didn't know" issues
- 5-10 minutes saved per shift handover

Track with:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shift_notes;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT shift_id) FROM shift_notes;
SELECT AVG(note_count) FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as note_count 
    FROM shift_notes 
    GROUP BY shift_id
) as s;
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Notes button not showing"
→ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### "You do not have access to this shift"
→ Normal! Can only view notes for your own shifts (or if admin)

### "Failed to load notes"
→ Check database table created: `SHOW TABLES LIKE 'shift_notes';`

### Push notifications not received
→ Verify push enabled in Settings
→ Check you're not the note author (no self-notification)

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

This is the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** - fully functional but room to grow!

### Phase 2 Ideas (if users love it):

- [ ] @Mentions (tag specific people)
- [ ] Note reactions (👍 ❤️ acknowledgments)
- [ ] Full-text search
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Daily digest email

### Would Also Be Cool:
- Auto-note when shift swapped
- Integration with incident reports
- Mobile app notifications
- Note analytics dashboard
